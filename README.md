# Dustii

> Robotics Engineer | AI Researcher | NLP Specialist

Building intelligent systems that solve real problems. My background spans robotics, AI model development, and natural language understanding systems. Currently focused on bridging the gap between theoretical AI research and practical robotic implementations.

## About

After years of working with various hardware configurations (Arduino, custom PCBs, PLC systems), I've developed a methodology that balances computational efficiency with practical deployment constraints. This approach has proven effective in both academic and commercial settings.

**Notable Achievement:** Top 3 finalist in the UEH Robot Dancing Competition, where I designed and programmed a multi-servo humanoid robot with adaptive movement patterns that synchronized with musical beat detection.
